            <h2>Pregnancy-Friendly Yoga Routine</h2>
            <p>Here‚Äôs a safe and gentle yoga routine you can practice 3-4 times a week to increase your flexibility, strength, and relaxation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cat-Cow Stretch</strong> (5-10 reps): This gentle stretch improves spinal flexibility and helps relieve back pain. Start on your hands and knees, alternate between arching and rounding your back, and breathe deeply.</li>
                <li><strong>Child‚Äôs Pose</strong> (Hold for 1-2 minutes): This restful pose gently stretches your back, hips, and thighs. Sit on your knees, lower your chest to the floor, and extend your arms forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Seated Forward Bend</strong> (Hold for 30 seconds): This pose stretches your hamstrings, back, and calves. Sit with legs extended straight in front of you, and gently bend forward while keeping your back straight.</li>
                <li><strong>Warrior II</strong> (Hold for 30 seconds per side): This pose strengthens your legs and opens your hips. Stand tall, step one foot back, bend your front knee, and extend both arms parallel to the floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Side-Lying Leg Raises</strong> (10 reps per side): This helps strengthen your hip muscles. Lie on your side, extend your top leg straight, and raise it towards the ceiling, then lower it back down.</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvic Tilts</strong> (10 reps): This movement helps strengthen your lower back and abdominal muscles. Lie on your back with knees bent, and gently tilt your pelvis up while tightening your abdominal muscles.</li>
                <li><strong>Breathing Exercise</strong> (5 minutes): Sit comfortably and focus on slow, deep breathing to calm the mind and improve oxygen flow to you and your baby.</li>
